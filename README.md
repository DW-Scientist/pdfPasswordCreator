# pdfPasswordCreator

Since securing your pdf is a premium function in adobe I decided to create a short python file which does this for free.

## 1. Colone the repo 
`git clone...`

## 2. Install the requirements 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 3. Test this baby
`python password.py`

## 4. The program will ask you for 3 different things
- Name of the pdf-file you want to secure (WITHOUT .pdf)
  `test`
- password you want to use
  `type_in_your_password`
- Name of the new secured pdf-file (WITHOUT .pdf)
  `test_with_password`

If you want to overwrite your pdf file just use the same file name - in this case `test`

## 5. Boom, now your secured pdf file should be displayed in your local repo - open it and type in the password to see the content - Have Fun!!!
